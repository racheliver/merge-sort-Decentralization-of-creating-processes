the program implement the sorting algorithm, "merge sort" in the distributed form (parallel calculation).

this project one part:
1) Decentralization of creating processes(תהליכונים) by share memory

 

***********what this program do************
 we will take part in sorting the array, 
when communication between them will be carried out with the help of global memory.

********** How to Compile this program*************

go to the file location and enter 'make'.


***********How to run this program***********

 ***********file.txt is *needed* to run the program************
 **The input for each of the questions in this exercise will be a file with the following three lines:**
 1) First line - the number of numbers to be sorted
 2) A strong number of  "The level of the mix". 
 3) the array numbers to be sorted
 **************************************************************

to run the share memory processes:
enter: ./ex4q1  (##) 


(##) - Enter the name of the TXT file (if in the ex3q1.c folder) Otherwise, enter the path to the file/

**********Description of program files*************

# ex4q1.c - global memory with processes 

# Makefile - compile all the programs

**********Description What input we needed*************

only the file.txt that Mentioned earlier
	
***********An explanation of the output we get************

the program print the sorted array to the screen
